Everything you want's a dream away
We are legends, every day
That's what she told him
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart beneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Turn your magic on, umi she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo-ooh, woo-ooh)
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through, oh
And if we've only got this life
And this adventure, oh then I
Wanna share it with you
With you, with you
Sing it, oh, say yeah
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo)`

  lyrics: `TTo be young and in love in New York City (In New York City)
To not know who I am, but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City (In New York City)
Midnight into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking
Damn, I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
I don't know what it is, but I got that feeling (got that feeling)
Wakin' up in this bed next to you
Swear the room, yeah, got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking
I might have to tell you somethin'
I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me
Eh-eh, eh-eh, oh
I like me better when I'm with you (yes I do, yes I do babe)
I like me better when I'm with you (oh no)
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
I'm with you`
